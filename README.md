# AM/FM Superheterodyning Radio Entesari ECEN 489 with [ELENCO kit](https://shop.elenco.com/consumers/am-fm-radio-kit-combo-ic-transistor.html)

## Project Description
- Soldering, testing dynamically and statically, and verifying superheterodyne AM/FM receiver in conjunction with ECEN-489, Wireless Communications course by Dr. Entesari at Texas A&amp;M, and  the ELENCO AM/FM SUPERHET RADIO kit https://shop.elenco.com/consumers/am-fm-radio-kit-combo-ic-transistor.html 

## Key Takeaways 
- Lab Practicals
  - Soldering approximately 50 total through hole components across AM/FM receiever signal paths, potentiometer volume controller/switch, gang capacitor tuners, and antennas
  
## RF Fundamentals
 - Noise Figure
    - Gaussian noise that is non-linear in nature and dominated by the first block of the design. For this reason, in some RF receiver topologies a LNA (Low noise amplifer is used to optimize overall noise figure, while boosting signal strength at the input)
- RLC filtering circuit and transformer impedance transformations
  - Q-factor
  - Bandwidth
  
## Design Tradeoffs
    - Foster Seely vs. Ratio Detector
    - Various circuit methods of AM / FM demodulation
    - Problem of filtering image at output of mixer stage
    - High Q vs. Bandwidth
    - AM Antenna utilizes ferrite core whereas FM Antenna utilizes monopole topology
      - AM RF is lower with a longer wavelength so impractical to implement with monopole antenna and must use ferrite core with magentic design
      - FM RF is higher with a lower wavelength so practical to implement with monpole antenna for receiving RF signals across air
